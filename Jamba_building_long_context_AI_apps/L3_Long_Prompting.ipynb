       "\"NVIDIA Corporation, a pioneer in accelerated computing, has become a full-stack computing infrastructure company with data-center-scale offerings. Their full-stack includes the foundational CUDA programming model and hundreds of domain-specific software libraries, software development kits, and application programming interfaces. NVIDIA's data-center-scale offerings include compute and networking solutions that can scale to tens of thousands of GPU-accelerated servers. The GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services to create unique value for the markets they serve. The company has invested over $45.3 billion in research and development since its inception, yielding inventions that are essential to modern computing. NVIDIA's acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 expanded its innovation canvas to include networking and led to the introduction of a new processor class ‚Äì the data processing unit, or DPU. In 2023, NVIDIA introduced its first data center CPU, Grace, built for giant-scale AI and high-performance computing. NVIDIA's key strategies include advancing the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform, extending its technology and platform leadership in AI, extending its technology and platform leadership in computer graphics, advancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform, and leveraging its intellectual property. NVIDIA's worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving its objective of providing markets with its high-performance and efficient computing platforms and software. NVIDIA's computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as data centers, gaming, professional visualization, and automotive. NVIDIA utilizes a fabless and contracting manufacturing strategy, whereby it employs and partners with key suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. NVIDIA's current competitors include suppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing solutions, including solutions offered for AI. NVIDIA relies primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect its IP in the United States and internationally. NVIDIA's worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments.
