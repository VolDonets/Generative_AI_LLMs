We evaluated our\\\\nmethod with the camera-trap images from the Alexander von Humboldt Biological\\\\nResources Research Institute. We obtained an accuracy of 92.65% classifying 8\\\\nmammal genera and a False Positive (FP) class, using automatic-segmented\\\\nimages. On the other hand, we reached 90.32% of accuracy classifying 10 mammal\\\\ngenera, using ground-truth images only.
